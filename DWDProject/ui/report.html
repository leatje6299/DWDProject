        <h3>Design Motivation</h3>
        <p>After reviewing the briefs, we all felt drawn to Community. This was due to a mix of interest in this, and not
            feeling connected to any of the others. We all started by researching a few dynamic websites to draw inspiration
            from. This allowed us to realise what we liked and were excited to accomplish. Madeleine also shared an article
            she had found about ‘Third Places’. Third Place refers to a sociological idea that describes a social or
            physical location used for leisure purposes that is separate from a person’s home and workplace. After lockdown,
            these places merged for a lot of people, and there have been studies to suggest strong correlation between the
            existence of a third place in someone’s daily life and increased happiness. Combined with our experiences of
            navigating a new city as a student, we decided to create a website that could solve this issue, combined with
            the parameters set up in the community brief.
            </br>
            The idea formed for our site as an interactive map that users (probably students) could add notes to, describing
            areas of their city that held significance or importance.
        </p>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
            We started by setting up a version control system which allowed us to always have a backup in case an error was
            made which could break the project. We used Github (link to it) with Github Desktop since it is more user
            friendly.
            </br>
            Madeleine and Hamasah started by doing a brief user research as well as setting up a simple wireframe and an
            architecture of the website.

            Madeleine created a survey, and sent it out - receiving 40 responses to do with people’s relationships to third
            places.

            The user research conducted demonstrated that a lot of people do have a third place which they get recommended
            through mainly friends, social media posts and visiting the city.

            Madeleine then set out creating user personas to identify key features that would
            </br>
            To start building up the website we went through the process of wireframing, incorporating in code, user testing
            and repeated that process. This allowed us to see what was feasible with our knowledge while being user
            friendly.
            </br>
            To develop the website, Lea first focussed on building up the main back-end functions such as retrieving data
            from the database, routing to navigate through the website or setting up sessions so users could login and
            register. Since another important part of our website was the map page, we focussed on that as well.

        </p>
        <h3>Execution</h3>
        <p>
            The map page was where most of the interactions of our website are, users are able to choose an existing
            location from the database, write a note and upload it. To avoid users uploading profanity, we use a profanity
            filter API checking whether or not the user’s note can be added to the database.
            </br>
            The user can either choose a location by going around the map or using the search bar. If a location is missing,
            the user is able to create a new location.
            </br>
            We were unable to use an API to retrieve map data since we wanted to create our own customised map which meant
            that it would require as much work to match another map's data for example matching each coordinate to then
            place the location pins to the right place. It was simpler to just create our own database and use online
            information to build it up.
