    <h2>what is third place?</h2>
    <p style="  width: 70vh"> a ‘third place’ refers to the sociological idea that human beings are happier when they have a third place that is separate from home (first place) and work (second place).

        in the pandemic, a lot of us lost not only a third place, but our second places too.

        this site was created to encourage locals to go out and explore their city in the hope of finding a new third place.

        explore, discover, and connect with locals by sharing your favourite spots in the city.

        feel free to add a note to the map! or simply just browse others stories.

        thirdplace is from locals, for locals.
